# Heart-Failure

One is every five people will develop heart failure, and 50% of heart failure patients die in 5 years. Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of body. With help of avaliable EMR, we could design a robust system which will be able to predict the possibility of heart failure accurately.


## Data Set 

This dataset was taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains the medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure, collected during their follow-up period, where each patient profile has 13 clinical features.

- high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (boolean)
- creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
- diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (boolean)
- ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)
- platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
- sex: woman or man (binary)
- serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
- serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
